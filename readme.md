# Better Number System
**By Rocky Studios**

Standard numbering in programming is good for just that, *standard programming*. But not all programming is standard programming, and sometimes you need a better way to handle numbers. This program addresses quite a few of these errors:

- Do not support units like litres or cm³

- No straightforward way to perform math with different units

This new number system (that adds on top of the base one) aims to address these issues and make progamming with numbers in certain fields better and easier.

**Currently in beta**
